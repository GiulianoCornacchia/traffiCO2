#### Abstract

Navigation systems use routing algorithms to suggest the most comfortable path to reach a specific destination given an origin or the current position. Although undoubtedly useful, navigation systems' impact on the urban environment (e.g., the CO$_2$ emissions generated and population exposure to NOx) are still largely unclear. In this work, we design a simulation framework to assess the impact of routing algorithms on CO$_2$ emissions within an urban environment. Using APIs from OpenStreetMap and TomTom, we find that settings in which either all vehicles or none of them follow a navigation system's suggestion lead to the worst impact in terms of CO$_2$ emissions. In contrast, when just a portion (around half) of vehicles follow these suggestions, and some degree of randomness is added to the path followed by the remaining vehicles, we observe a reduction of the overall CO$_2$ emissions over the road network. Our work is a first step towards designing new generation routing principles that may increase urban well-being while satisfying individual needs.


## How to install and configure SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) ðŸš—ðŸš™ðŸ›»

### Install SUMO

Please always refer to the [SUMO Installation page](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Installing/index.html)
for the latest installation instructions.

#### > Windows

To install SUMO on Windows it is necessary to download the installer [here](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Downloads.php#windows) and run the executable.

#### > Linux

To install SUMO on Linux is it necessary to execute the following commands:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:sumo/stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sumo sumo-tools sumo-doc
```

#### > macOS

SUMO can be installed on macOS via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

You can install and update Homebrew as following:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
brew update
brew install --cask xquartz
```
To install SUMO:
```
brew tap dlr-ts/sumo
brew install sumo
```


### Configure SUMO

After installing SUMO you must configure your `PATH` and `SUMO_HOME` environment variables.

Suppose you installed SUMO at `/your/path/to/sumo-<version>`

#### > Windows
1. On the Windows search box search for "Edit the system environment variables" option and open it;
2. Under user variables select `PATH` and click Edit. If no such variable exists you must create it with the New-Button; 
3. Append `;/your/path/to/sumo-<version>/bin` to the end of the `PATH` value (do not delete the existing values);
4. Under user variables select `SUMO_HOME` and click Edit. If no such variable exists you must create it with the New-Button;
5. Set `/your/path/to/sumo-<version>` as the value of the `SUMO_HOME` variable.

#### > Linux

1. Open a file explorer and go to `/home/YOUR_NAME/`;
2. Open the file named `.bashrc` with a text editor;
3. Place this code export `SUMO_HOME="/your/path/to/sumo-<version>/"` somewhere in the file and save;
4. Reboot your computer.


#### > macOS

First you need to determine which shell (bash or zsh) you are currently working with. In a terminal, `type ps -p $$`.

##### ZSH

In a Terminal, execute the following steps:

1. Run the command `open ~/.zshrc`, this will open the `.zshrc` file in TextEdit;
2. Add the following line to that document: `export SUMO_HOME="/your/path/to/sumo-<version>"` and save it;
3. Apply the changes by entering: `source ~/.zshrc`.

##### bash

In a Terminal, execute the following steps:

1. Run the command `open ~/.bash_profile`, this will open the `.bash_profile` file in TextEdit;
2. Add the following line to that document: `export SUMO_HOME="/your/path/to/sumo-<version>"` and save it;
3. Apply the changes by entering: `source ~/.bash_profile`.
